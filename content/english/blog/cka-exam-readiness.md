# Are You Really Ready for the CKA Exam? 16 Topics to Test Your Preparedness

## Introduction

Does this sound familiar? You schedule your CKA exam, then as the date approaches, anxiety kicks in. "Am I really prepared? Maybe I need another 10 days..." So you reschedule. Ten days later, the same doubts return, and the cycle continues.

I've been there. This frustrating loop of uncertainty can be broken with a clear understanding of what "exam readiness" actually means.

This blog isn't just another Kubernetes tutorial. It's a readiness assessment based on 16 real-world topics that mirror what you'll face in the CKA exam. Consider it a final checklist to determine if you're truly prepared or need more focused practice.

As prerequisites, you should already:
- Understand Kubernetes cluster architecture
- Have followed comprehensive guides like Mumshad Mannambeth's CKA course
- Have hands-on experience with Kubernetes

But knowing concepts and being exam-ready are different things. Let's determine where you stand.

## Self-Assessment: Are You Ready?

Before diving into the topics, ask yourself these questions. Be honest—your certification success depends on it.

### Basic Readiness
1. **Do I understand Kubernetes cluster architecture and how components interact?**
2. **Am I comfortable working with Services (especially NodePort) and Deployments?**
3. **Can I create and manage basic resources using kubectl and YAML manifests?**

### Intermediate Readiness
1. **Do I know how to configure Horizontal Pod Autoscaling?**
2. **Have I configured TLS for services before?**
3. **Do I understand why we need Ingress controllers and how to set them up?**
4. **Can I manage resources for multi-container pods with sidecars/init containers?**

### Advanced Readiness
1. **Can I troubleshoot cluster issues affecting control plane components?**
2. **Am I comfortable configuring storage (PV, PVC, StorageClasses)?**
3. **Have I worked with NetworkPolicies to secure pod communication?**

**The Simple Rule**: If your answer is "no" to even one of these questions, you're not ready for the exam yet. Focus your remaining preparation time on those specific areas.

Now, let's explore the 16 topics that will test these skills in practice.

## Core Kubernetes Concepts

### 1. ConfigMaps and TLS Security

**Topic Overview:** Configuring Nginx with TLS 1.3 only, enhancing security by disabling older, less secure protocols.

In this exercise, I worked with ConfigMaps to manage Nginx configuration and enforce TLS 1.3 only connections. This demonstrated how to:

- Use ConfigMaps to externalize configuration from container images
- Configure TLS settings for increased security
- Apply security best practices to Kubernetes workloads

This is crucial for the CKA exam as it tests your ability to secure applications and services running in Kubernetes, a key responsibility of a Kubernetes administrator.

### 2. Exposing Applications via NodePort Service

**Topic Overview:** Exposing an Nginx web server outside the Kubernetes cluster using a NodePort service.

This task focused on making applications accessible from outside the cluster by:

- Creating a NodePort service to expose the application
- Understanding service types and their use cases
- Configuring the correct port mappings

Service exposure is a fundamental skill assessed in the exam, as it tests your understanding of how applications communicate within and outside the cluster.

## Networking

### 3. Installing Container Network Interface (CNI)

**Topic Overview:** Installing Calico CNI to provide networking and network policy capabilities.

This exercise demonstrated how to:

- Install the Tigera Operator and custom resource definitions
- Configure Calico for pod-to-pod networking
- Verify the installation and functionality of network components

CNI plugins are essential for Kubernetes networking, and understanding their installation and configuration is a critical skill tested in the CKA exam.

### 4. Configuring Ingress Resources

**Topic Overview:** Setting up an Ingress resource with TLS to securely expose a web application.

In this task, I configured:

- An Ingress resource with proper routing rules
- TLS termination for secure HTTPS access
- Integration with the Nginx Ingress Controller

Ingress resources are vital for managing external access to services in a cluster, and the exam frequently tests candidates' ability to configure them correctly.

### 5. Migrating from Ingress to Gateway API

**Topic Overview:** Transitioning from traditional Kubernetes Ingress to the newer Gateway API.

This advanced networking task involved:

- Understanding the Gateway API's components: GatewayClass, Gateway, and HTTPRoute
- Migrating existing ingress configurations to the Gateway API model
- Maintaining secure TLS access throughout the migration

While the Gateway API is relatively new, this task demonstrates the evolution of Kubernetes APIs and tests adaptability to changing technologies—a valuable skill for any Kubernetes administrator.

### 6. Network Policies for Cross-Namespace Communication

**Topic Overview:** Configuring Network Policies to control communication between pods in different namespaces.

This exercise required:

- Analyzing communication requirements between services
- Implementing the principle of least privilege
- Creating and applying appropriate NetworkPolicy resources

Network Policies are critical for securing cluster communications, and the ability to implement them correctly is frequently tested in the CKA exam.

## Workload Management

### 7. Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)

**Topic Overview:** Configuring an HPA with custom behavior parameters for an Nginx deployment.

This task demonstrated how to:

- Create an HPA based on CPU utilization
- Configure scaling behavior with stabilization windows
- Understand metrics collection and scaling algorithms

Autoscaling is essential for managing application workloads efficiently, and the CKA exam tests your ability to implement it correctly.

### 8. Adding Sidecar Containers for Logging

**Topic Overview:** Enhancing a deployment with a sidecar container for log processing.

In this exercise, I:

- Added a sidecar container to an existing deployment
- Configured volume sharing between containers
- Implemented a multi-container pod architecture

Sidecar patterns are common in production Kubernetes environments, and understanding how to implement them shows your ability to design effective pod architectures.

### 9. Adjusting Pod Resource Requests

**Topic Overview:** Modifying resource requests and limits to ensure pods can run on resource-constrained nodes.

This task involved:

- Analyzing node resource capacity
- Calculating appropriate resource requests and limits
- Adjusting deployment specifications to optimize resource usage

Resource management is a critical skill for Kubernetes administrators, and the CKA exam frequently tests your ability to troubleshoot and resolve resource-related issues.

### 10. Priority Classes for Pod Scheduling

**Topic Overview:** Creating PriorityClasses and applying them to deployments to influence scheduling decisions.

This advanced scheduling task required:

- Understanding priority values and their impact on scheduling
- Configuring PriorityClasses with appropriate settings
- Applying priority settings to existing workloads

Pod scheduling and priority are important concepts in Kubernetes resource management, and mastering them is essential for the CKA exam.

## Storage

### 11. Creating Default Storage Classes

**Topic Overview:** Configuring a high-performance StorageClass and making it the cluster default.

In this exercise, I:

- Created a StorageClass with specific performance parameters
- Made it the default StorageClass for the cluster
- Understood the relationship between StorageClasses and PersistentVolumes

Storage configuration is a key area of the CKA exam, and demonstrating proficiency in managing StorageClasses is important for success.

### 12. Working with PersistentVolumes and PersistentVolumeClaims

**Topic Overview:** Recovering a deleted deployment by reusing an existing PersistentVolume.

This task focused on:

- Understanding PV binding and reclaim policies
- Creating a PVC that can bind to a specific existing PV
- Redeploying an application to use the recovered storage

Data persistence and recovery are critical in production environments, and the CKA exam tests your ability to handle these scenarios.

## Advanced Kubernetes Concepts

### 13. Managing Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)

**Topic Overview:** Listing and documenting cert-manager Custom Resource Definitions.

This exercise demonstrated how to:

- Work with CRDs that extend the Kubernetes API
- Extract documentation for specific CRD fields
- Understand the role of CRDs in Kubernetes extensibility

CRDs are increasingly important in Kubernetes ecosystems, and understanding them shows your ability to work with extended Kubernetes functionality.

### 14. Using Helm for Application Deployment

**Topic Overview:** Installing Argo CD using Helm and generating templates.

In this task, I:

- Added Helm repositories and managed charts
- Generated Helm templates with specific configurations
- Installed applications with custom settings

Helm is widely used for Kubernetes application deployment, and familiarity with it demonstrates broader ecosystem knowledge important for the CKA exam.

## System Administration

### 15. Installing Packages with dpkg

**Topic Overview:** Preparing a Linux system for Kubernetes with cri-dockerd installation.

This system administration task involved:

- Installing packages using dpkg
- Configuring system parameters for Kubernetes
- Setting up persistent configurations across reboots

While the CKA focuses primarily on Kubernetes, understanding the underlying host system is essential for effective cluster management.

## Troubleshooting

### 16. Troubleshooting Control Plane Components

**Topic Overview:** Identifying and fixing issues affecting key Kubernetes control plane components.

This comprehensive troubleshooting exercise required:

- Diagnosing issues with kube-apiserver, kube-scheduler, and kubelet
- Fixing configuration errors and service failures
- Understanding the interdependencies between control plane components

Troubleshooting is a significant portion of the CKA exam, and this task demonstrates the types of issues you might need to resolve during the test.

## The Readiness Verdict: What These Topics Tell You

Now that you've reviewed the 16 topics, let's interpret what they mean for your exam readiness:

### If You're Comfortable with All Topics:
You're likely ready for the exam. The CKA tests practical skills, and if you can confidently work through these scenarios, you have the necessary hands-on experience.

### If You Struggled with Some Topics:
Identify the specific areas of weakness and focus your remaining preparation time there. Don't reschedule yet—targeted practice might get you ready faster than you think.

### If Multiple Topics Were Unfamiliar:
You should consider more practice before taking the exam. But rather than indefinitely postponing, set a specific preparation schedule with clear milestones.

## Breaking the Rescheduling Cycle

The endless cycle of rescheduling often stems from a lack of clear benchmarks for readiness. Use this checklist to make an objective assessment:

1. **Can you complete practice exercises for all 16 topics without consulting solutions?**
2. **Can you troubleshoot when things go wrong?**
3. **Are you comfortable navigating the Kubernetes documentation to find information quickly?**
4. **Can you complete most tasks within time constraints (typically 5-15 minutes per task)?**

If you answered "yes" to all of these, **stop rescheduling**. You're ready. Perfect readiness doesn't exist—there will always be more to learn. Trust your preparation and take the exam.

## Final Preparation Tips

In your final days before the exam:

1. **Practice time management**: The CKA is time-constrained. Practice completing tasks efficiently.

2. **Master kubectl commands**: Become fluent with the commands you'll use frequently.

3. **Create bookmarks in documentation**: Prepare a strategy for quickly finding information.

4. **Practice reading and modifying YAML**: Many exam tasks involve modifying existing manifests.

5. **Simulate exam conditions**: Practice in an environment similar to the exam setup.

6. **Rest and recharge**: Mental freshness is as important as technical knowledge.

## Exam-Day Tips and Tricks for Time Management

Time management is the most critical factor in the CKA exam. Here are some invaluable tips that can save you precious minutes:

### 1. Pre-map Documentation Resources

**Golden Rule**: Never search for topics you're confident will appear in the exam without preparation.

Before the exam, identify topics you're certain will be tested (like PV/PVC, NetworkPolicies, etc.) and:
- Practice finding the example manifests in the Kubernetes documentation
- Memorize which search result contains the example you need (e.g., "for PVC, it's the second link")
- Remember the specific location pattern (e.g., "when I search for 'network policy', the example manifest is in the first link")

This approach might seem trivial, but it can save 3-5 minutes per question—potentially 30+ minutes across the entire exam! I didn't follow this method in my first attempt and lost valuable time navigating documentation.

### 2. Quick Namespace Switching

Set up a browser tab with this command ready to modify and execute:
```bash
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=<namespace>
```

When a new question specifies a different namespace, quickly switch to this tab, update the namespace name, and execute it. This is faster than typing the command from scratch each time or constantly adding `-n namespace` to every kubectl command.

### 3. Master Search Techniques

Practice these search techniques that will help you work faster:
- Use `grep` effectively to filter command outputs: `kubectl get pods -A | grep nginx`
- When editing files with vi, use `:/search_term` to quickly find text
- Combine commands with pipes to filter and format output efficiently

### 4. Skip and Return Strategy

Don't get stuck on difficult questions:
- Give yourself a strict time limit for each question (e.g., 5-7 minutes)
- If you can't make progress within that time, mark the question and move on
- Return to challenging questions after completing the easier ones
- Sometimes solutions become clearer after working through other questions

## My CKA Exam Experience: A Tale of Two Attempts

When registering for the CKA exam, you get two attempts—a safety net I ended up needing. Here's how my journey from failure to success unfolded, and the valuable lessons I learned along the way.

### The First Attempt: A Humbling Experience

Like many candidates, I had read countless tips and tricks before my first attempt. But knowing advice and following it are two different things.

I expected questions on Ingress and other common topics, yet when they appeared, I still spent 3-4 precious minutes searching through documentation links to find the correct YAML templates. This seemingly small inefficiency added up quickly.

After the first hour—half my allotted time—I had completed just 5 questions. The fifth question involved resource management for a multi-container deployment. I misinterpreted the requirements, changing both resource limits and requests when I should have only modified the requests. This mistake cost me even more time.

By the two-hour mark, I had managed to complete 12 questions and was working on the 13th (migrating Ingress to Gateway API). I had just created the Gateway resource when the timer hit zero.

**Result: 61%** — not enough to pass.

I sat there staring at my screen, not disappointed in my knowledge, but in my execution. The realization hit me: what prevented me from passing wasn't a lack of technical skills, but poor time management.

### The Week Between: Strategic Recalibration

I took just one week to address my time management issues through rigorous practice with a new approach:

1. I categorized expected tasks into two groups:
   - Tasks requiring YAML examples from documentation (Ingress, NetworkPolicies, etc.)
   - Tasks that could be handled through direct editing (sidecars, resource management)

2. I practiced locating and memorizing exactly where to find YAML examples for common tasks

3. I drilled myself on quick command execution and rapid troubleshooting

### The Second Attempt: A Strategic Victory

On my second attempt, I entered with a clear battle plan:

**First hour strategy:** Tackle all tasks requiring documentation lookups first, leaving the editing-heavy tasks for later. For each task on my "expected list," I recalled exactly where to find the template rather than searching on the fly.

Result? By the end of the first hour, I had completed 11 tasks, skipping only two that required detailed editing rather than reference materials.

**Second hour approach:** In just 15 more minutes, I finished all remaining tasks except the troubleshooting challenge and my two flagged tasks.

With 45 minutes remaining, I tackled the troubleshooting task first, spending about 12 minutes correcting an incorrect IP address in the kube-apiserver static pod manifest. When I couldn't get the pods running after a reasonable effort, I made a strategic decision to move on rather than sink more time into it.

I then completed my two flagged questions correctly and finished the exam with time to spare.

**Result: 84%** — a comfortable pass!

### The Difference-Maker

What changed between my two attempts wasn't my Kubernetes knowledge—it was my approach to time management and documentation use. By pre-mapping my resources and strategically prioritizing questions, I transformed a failing score into a successful certification.

The most valuable lesson? In the CKA exam, knowing where to find information quickly is just as important as knowing Kubernetes itself.
